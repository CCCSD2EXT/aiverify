In the fast-evolving world of AI today, a concerted global community effort is required to keep our AI governance and testing capabilities on par with the state of the art in AI development and use. AI Verify is developed as an open-source, extensible tool to allow third-party developers and researchers to add to a global body of work. One way in which these contributors can extend the testing functionalities of AI Verify is through building plugins.

## Plugins

Plugins are the basis of testing functionalities in the AI Verify Toolkit. The toolkit comes with a set of pre-installed plugins that contain the technical tests and process checks required by the AI Verify Testing Framework. To extend this basic set of testing functionalities, you can install plugins built by the AI Verify Foundation and other third-party developers.

Plugins can consist of algorithms, widgets, input blocks, and report templates and they work together as such: 

| Plugin component | Description |
| ---------- | ---- |
| Algorithms | AI model testing algorithms |
| Input Blocks | User input capture fields |
| Widgets | Report components to visualize data/ test results |
| Templates | Defines customised report layouts |
