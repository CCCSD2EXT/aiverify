In the report generating page, the progress and logs of each technical test being run is displayed. These logs can be used for debugging purposes for failed test runs. To abort any tests being run, click on ‘Stop’.

Once all tests have completed running, a PDF report will be generated and you can view it in your browser by clicking on ‘View Report’.
