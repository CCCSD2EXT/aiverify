Once model validation is completed, you can view the model information on the right panel.

If the model is invalid, refer to the error message for more information.

If the model is valid, you can edit the model name, description and model type by clicking on '**Edit**'. You should include a short description of the model if you are using the AI Verify report templates. You can also update the Model Name.
