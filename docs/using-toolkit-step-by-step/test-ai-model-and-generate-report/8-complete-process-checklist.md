Complete each testable criteria by indicating its criterion completion status:

- **Yes:** The criterion is implemented with documentary evidence.
- **No:** The criterion has not been implemented.
- **Not Applicable:** The criterion is not relevant to the use case.

You can provide relevant elaboration as such:

- **If Yes**, describe how the process checks is implemented and/or how the
  evidence has been documented. (where applicable)
- **If No**, state the reason(s) for not implementing the process checks or not documenting evidence.
- **If Not Applicable**, state reason(s)
