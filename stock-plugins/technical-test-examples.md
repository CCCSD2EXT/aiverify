# Technical Test Examples
Below is a table with a sample list of techical tests that can be run with AI Verify. All Models and Test Datasets can be found at `aiverify/stock-plugins/user-defined-files/`. These Models and Test Datasets has to be uploaded to AI Verify Portal before running the technical test. Models indicated [`Model File`] means that Model File have to be uploaded via the Upload AI Model Method while Models indicated [`Pipeline Folder`] means that the Pipeline Folder has to be uploaded via the Upload Pipeline Method.
